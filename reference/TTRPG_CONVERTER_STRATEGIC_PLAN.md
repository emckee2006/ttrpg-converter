# TTRPGConverter - Strategic Vision & Implementation Plan

## 🎯 **PROJECT VISION: COMPREHENSIVE TTRPG CONTENT TRANSFORMATION**

**Mission**: Transform TTRPG campaign content between any format - VTT-to-VTT, VTT-to-PDF, VTT-to-print, enabling content creators and GMs to reach any audience.

## 🚀 **EXPANDED SCOPE & CAPABILITIES**

### **Phase 1: Core VTT Conversion (Current Focus)**
- Roll20 → Foundry VTT (current strength)
- Foundry VTT → Roll20 (reverse conversion)
- Native Rust architecture with single binary distribution

### **Phase 2: Multi-VTT Support** 
- Fantasy Grounds conversion support
- MapTool, Astral VTT integration
- Universal campaign format as intermediate representation

### **Phase 3: Non-VTT Output Formats**
- **PDF Generation**: Campaign books, handouts, character sheets
- **Print-Friendly**: Optimized layouts for physical play
- **Web Formats**: Standalone HTML campaign browsers
- **Mobile**: Optimized formats for tablet/phone reference

### **Phase 4: Content Creation Ecosystem**
- Campaign template system
- Asset marketplace integration
- Community content sharing
- Automated content generation tools

## 🏗️ **CLEAN SLATE ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS**

### **Project Identity**
- **Name**: `TTRPGConverter` 
- **Repository**: New GitHub repo (not fork) - clean slate identity
- **Planning**: GitHub Projects/Issues (native integration)
- **Reference**: Keep current R20Converter as `reference/r20converter-legacy`

### **Technical Foundation**
- **Language**: Pure Rust (no Python dependencies)
- **GUI**: Native egui (no web stack)
- **Distribution**: Single binary with all dependencies
- **Configuration**: TOML-based with sensible defaults
- **Architecture**: Clean workspace with proper separation of concerns

### **Workspace Structure**

```

## 📋 **PLANNING MIGRATION STRATEGY**

### **Immediate Actions (This Week)**
1. **Create new GitHub repository**: `ttrpg-converter`
2. **Initialize GitHub Projects**: Kanban board with milestones
3. **Migrate core planning**: Convert current plans to GitHub Issues
4. **Set up development environment**: Clean Rust workspace
5. **Preserve reference**: Archive current implementation

### **Planning Platform Migration**
- **From**: Local Obsidian notes (disconnected from development)
- **To**: GitHub Projects + Issues (integrated with development workflow)
- **Benefits**: Version control, community visibility, CI/CD integration
- **Timeline**: Immediate - can migrate core planning in 1-2 hours

### **Reference Preservation**
- Keep current `r20converter-rust/` as `reference/r20converter-pyo3/`
- Preserve all analysis, lessons learned, architectural insights
- Use as reference for functionality requirements
- Document migration decisions and architectural improvements

## 🎯 **DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES**

### **Milestone 1: Foundation (3 weeks)**
- Clean Rust workspace with proper architecture
- Core conversion engine with trait-based entity system
- Native GUI foundation with egui
- CLI interface with comprehensive options

### **Milestone 2: Core VTT Conversion (4 weeks)**
- Complete Roll20 → Foundry VTT conversion
- Parallel processing pipeline for performance
- Asset handling with intelligent caching
- Comprehensive testing with real campaigns

### **Milestone 3: Enhanced Features (2 weeks)**
- Advanced GUI features (dark mode, batch processing)
- Performance optimization and memory management
- Documentation and user guides
- Release preparation and distribution

### **Future Milestones: Ecosystem Expansion**
- Multi-VTT support (Fantasy Grounds, etc.)
- PDF generation capabilities
- Print-optimized output formats
- Community features and content sharing

## 🚀 **COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES**

### **Technical Excellence**
- **5-10x performance improvement** over Python version
- **Single binary distribution** - no dependency management
- **Native GUI** - better UX than web-based interfaces
- **Parallel processing** - utilize all CPU cores effectively

### **Format Flexibility**
- **Multi-output support** - not just VTT-to-VTT
- **Future-proof architecture** - easy to add new formats
- **Intermediate representation** - universal campaign format
- **Extensible plugin system** - community format support

### **User Experience**
- **Professional interface** with modern UX patterns
- **Comprehensive error handling** with actionable suggestions
- **Progress tracking** with detailed feedback
- **Batch processing** for campaign management workflows

## 📊 **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Technical Goals**
- 90%+ code coverage with comprehensive testing
- Sub-10MB binary size for distribution
- <30 second conversion time for typical campaigns
- Zero-dependency deployment across platforms

### **User Experience Goals**
- One-click conversion for common workflows
- Comprehensive documentation with examples
- Active community engagement and feedback
- Professional-quality output matching manual conversion

This strategic vision transforms TTRPGConverter from a simple conversion tool into a comprehensive ecosystem for TTRPG content transformation and distribution.
