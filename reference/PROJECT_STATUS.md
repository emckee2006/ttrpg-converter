# TTRPGConverter - DLL Plugin Architecture

## 🚀 **STRATEGIC PIVOT: DLL-BASED PLUGIN ARCHITECTURE**

### 🎯 MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL BREAKTHROUGH!

**Date**: 2025-08-17  
**Latest Decision**: DLL-Based Plugin System with Dynamic Loading  
**Previous Approach**: Monolithic Rust Binary (EVOLVED)

### 🎯 **STRATEGIC DECISIONS MADE**

#### DLL Plugin Architecture Decision
- **🏗️ ARCHITECTURE**: Dynamic plugin loading with unified format handlers
- **📁 PROJECT STRUCTURE**: Core engine + Plugin DLLs (Roll20.dll, Foundry.dll, Pathbuilder.dll)
- **🔌 PLUGIN SYSTEM**: Unified format plugins (import+export+mappings in single DLL)
- **⚡ PERFORMANCE**: Lazy loading - only load plugins as needed
- **🚀 DISTRIBUTION**: Lean core + modular plugin ecosystem

#### Plugin Architecture Benefits
- **MODULARITY**: Format handlers as independent DLLs with shared services
- **MEMORY EFFICIENCY**: Only load plugins when processing specific formats
- **PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT**: Platform plugins can be developed independently
- **EXTENSIBILITY**: New platforms via plugin development without core changes
- **DISTRIBUTION**: Desktop app with plugin directory - easy updates

### 📋 **CURRENT STATUS**

#### Foundation Complete ✅
- **M1.1-M1.3**: Project structure, RustLogger, RustValidator services complete
- **Compilation Status**: Zero errors, all foundation services operational
- **Architecture**: Clean service abstraction with dependency injection ready

#### Next Phase: M1.4 Plugin System 🚀
- **Database Layer**: LevelDB/NeDB integration for Foundry world data
- **Plugin Loading**: Dynamic DLL loading with shared services
- **Format Detection**: Auto-detect Roll20, Foundry, Pathbuilder files
- **Orchestration**: Unified plugin management and coordination

| **Blocked Items** | 0 (0%) | ✅ |
| **Estimated Timeline** | 9 weeks remaining | ⏰ |

### ✅ **FOUNDATION COMPLETE**
- M1.1: Project Structure Setup (6pts) ✅
- M1.2: RustLogger Service (6pts) ✅
- M1.3: RustValidator Service (8pts) ✅
- Service Integration (4pts) ✅

**Total Foundation**: 20/109 points complete (18%)
 ## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS**

**Immediate Priority**: M1.4 Core Foundation + Plugin System
- Database layer integration (LevelDB/NeDB)
- File format support & detection
- Plugin loading system with dynamic DLL support
- Orchestration framework with shared services

**Architecture Benefits**:
- Modular plugin ecosystem
- Memory efficient (lazy loading)
- Parallel plugin development
- Clean service abstraction

## 🏗️ **PLUGIN ARCHITECTURE BENEFITS**

### **Memory Efficiency**
- Only load Roll20.dll when processing Roll20 files
- Only load Foundry.dll when processing Foundry worlds
- Core engine stays lean (~5-10MB vs 50MB+ monolith)

### **Development Scalability**
- Platform teams can develop plugins independently
- New VTT support via plugin development
- Core engine updates don't require plugin rebuilds

### **User Experience**
- Desktop application with plugin discovery
- Automatic format detection and plugin loading
- Plugin updates without full application reinstall

### **Technical Excellence**
- Shared services (database, validation, compendium)
- Unified processing pipeline across all plugins
- Professional error handling and logging throughout

---

**Status**: 🚀 **READY FOR M1.4** - Plugin architecture designed, foundation complete, ready for database layer and dynamic loading implementation.
