## üîÑ SYNERGISTIC DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES

**Key Insight**: New features often ACCELERATE migration rather than compete with it

**Database Service Synergy**: Phase 1.3 + Phase 4.1
- Database abstraction for current migration needs
- Same service handles Foundry version conversion
- **Result**: One implementation serves two major features

**Asset Pipeline Synergy**: Phase 2.1 + Phase 4.3  
- Enhanced asset service for R20‚ÜíFoundry conversion
- Same optimizations benefit Foundry version migration
- **Result**: Better asset handling for all conversion types

**Entity Framework Synergy**: Phase 3.1 + Phase 4.2
- System-abstracted entity processing for Python migration
- Same framework enables cross-system conversion
- **Result**: Multi-system support emerges naturally from migration architecture

This synergistic approach means new features often come "for free" as byproducts of well-architected migration work!
