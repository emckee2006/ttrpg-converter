//! Roll20 Campaign mappings
//! 
//! Roll20 exports don't contain a Campaign struct - they contain collections
//! of characters, pages, handouts, etc. Campaign-level information would need
//! to be reconstructed from the export metadata or provided separately.

// No Campaign struct exists in Roll20 generated schemas
// Campaign information is inferred from the export structure
