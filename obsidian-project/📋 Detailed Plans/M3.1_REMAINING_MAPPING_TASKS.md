# M3.1: Remaining Mapping and Integration Tasks

**Author:** Gemini
**Date:** 2024-07-25
**Status:** Proposed
**Depends On:** `M1.8_FINAL_ASSET_PIPELINE.md`

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the remaining implementation tasks required to complete the core functionality of the TTRPG Converter. With the foundational AutoMapper profiles now in place for most entities, the work is divided into two main categories: completing the detailed mapping for complex entities and building the high-level services to orchestrate the conversion process.

## 2. Detailed Mapping Tasks (Completing the Profiles)

These tasks involve enhancing our existing AutoMapper profiles with more granular logic, based on a careful review of the `scenes.py` reference and our mapping guides.

### 2.1. Scene Mapping (`PageToSceneProfile`)

-   **Task:** Map Roll20 `paths` to Foundry `walls` and `drawings`.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   Create a new `PagePathsResolver`.
    -   This resolver will iterate through the `paths` on a Roll20 `Page`.
    -   It will use heuristics (e.g., checking the `stroke` color, path complexity) to differentiate between simple lines (walls) and freehand shapes (drawings).
    -   It will map wall lines to `Wall` documents, correctly identifying **doors** based on their stroke color.
    -   It will map freehand shapes and polygons to `Drawing` documents.

-   **Task:** Map Roll20 `text` objects to Foundry `drawings`.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   Create a new `PageTextResolver`.
    -   This resolver will convert Roll20 text objects into Foundry `Drawing` documents with the `type` set to `text`.
    -   It must preserve the text content, position, font, size, and color.

### 2.2. Item Mapping (`Roll20ItemProfile`)

-   **Task:** Infer more specific item types.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   Enhance the `AfterMap` logic in the `Roll20ItemProfile`.
    -   Add heuristics to identify `consumable`, `tool`, and `feat` types from the Roll20 item data (e.g., by checking for keywords in the item name or description) and set the `Dnd5eitemtype` enum accordingly.

### 2.3. Card Mapping (`Roll20CardToFoundryCardProfile`)

-   **Task:** Map multiple card faces.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   Create a `CardFacesResolver`.
    -   This resolver will handle the logic for cards that have different front and back images, creating multiple `Face` objects in the Foundry `Card`'s `faces` array.

## 3. Integration and Orchestration Tasks

This is the final phase of the core logic development, where we tie all the individual mappings together.

### 3.1. `ConversionService`

-   **Task:** Create the main `ConversionService.cs`.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   This service will inject the `IMapper`, `Roll20CampaignService`, and `FoundryWorldBuilder`.
    -   It will contain the main `ConvertCampaignAsync` method.
    -   This method will load the source campaign, iterate through each entity type (characters, handouts, pages, etc.), and use `_mapper.Map<TDestination>(source)` to convert them into lists of Foundry documents.

### 3.2. `FoundryWorldBuilder`

-   **Task:** Implement the `FoundryWorldBuilder.cs`.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   This service will receive the lists of converted Foundry documents from the `ConversionService`.
    -   It will be responsible for creating the world directory structure (`data/`, `assets/`, etc.).
    -   It will serialize each document list into the appropriate NeDB database file (e.g., `actors.db`, `items.db`, `scenes.db`).

### 3.3. Actor-Item Linking

-   **Task:** Connect converted Items to their owner Actor.
-   **Implementation:**
    -   This logic belongs in the `ConversionService` or `FoundryWorldBuilder`.
    -   After all `Dnd5eItem` documents have been created and mapped, the service will iterate through the `Dnd5eActor` documents.
    -   For each actor, it will find all the items that belong to it and add their `_id` to the actor's `items` array before saving.

This comprehensive plan provides a clear roadmap to completing the converter. The next logical step is to begin the detailed mapping tasks, starting with the `Page` to `Scene` walls and drawings.
